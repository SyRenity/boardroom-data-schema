# Data Schema's
Our data storage schema designs for proposals and other governance related items

## Influence
Much of the data schema design is influenced by http://schema.org/.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the data schema designs, please make a BRIP proposal.

See:

## IPFS
These data schema's will be used for data storage in IPFS repositories. Generally, these IPFS repositories will be publicly available, and will enrich the BoardRoom governance experience in a decentralized and distributed way.
